# PyQt
PyQt is a Python wrapper around the QT framwork for creating UIs. 

It is interesting because it simplifies lots of work for the developers expecially with its powerful Qt Designer. 

Within minutes users can create a decent GUI that has nice features such as Menubar, Calender, Text Edito etc.  

I have coded GUI in Java and OCaml before and I found this Python version particularly helpful :)
